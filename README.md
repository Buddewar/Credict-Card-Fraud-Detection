# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest Machine Leaning Algorithm


Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, identify patterns, and uncover potential relationships between variables.
Utilized visualization techniques to present findings and guide feature selection and engineering efforts.

 Employed advanced data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. Conducted feature engineering to extract relevant features and enhance model performance.

 Developed a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Streamlit, allowing stakeholders to interact with the fraud detection system intuitively and visualize key insights.
